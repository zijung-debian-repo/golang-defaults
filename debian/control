Description: Go programming language compiler - metapackage
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees
 that (most of) a full Go development environment is installed.

Description: Go programming language -- gccgo on "non-Go" platforms
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and

 .
 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and
 compiled standard library or gccgo on architectures that do not have a native
 toolchain ("gc compiler") port. Because the gccgo and Go releases are not on
 the same schedule, it is not guaranteed that the version of the Go language
 provided by the version of gccgo that this package depends upon will match the
 version of this package.

 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and
 compiled standard library. It is only built on architectures that have a
 native toolchain ("gc compiler"). Packages that want to build with whichever
 of gc or gccgo is available should depend on golang-any.

 Installing this package will install the gccgo implementation as /usr/bin/go.
 It conflicts with golang-go.
